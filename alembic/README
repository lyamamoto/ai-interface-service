This directory contains Alembic migration scripts for managing database schema changes.

Usage:
- Run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"` to generate a new migration script.
- Run `alembic upgrade head` to apply all migrations to the database.
- Run `alembic downgrade -1` to downgrade the database by one revision.
- Customize the generated migration scripts as needed before applying them to the database.
